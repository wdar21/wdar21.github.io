    <p> The ability to understand the content and structure of documents as well as text that appears in the form of handwriting or scene text is critical for intelligent systems to operate and interact with humans. With advances from research in the past few decades, the area has moved from solutions that work with highly restricted data to real-world degraded noisy document images and those acquired using hand-held cameras or handwriting data captured by mobile devices. The fifth workshop on document analysis and recognition aims to provide a platform for researchers to present techniques for solving such problems and interact with their peers in academia and industry. </p>

      <b><a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/">Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan</a></b> is currently serving as an Institute Chair Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Bombay. He is also the Professor-in-charge of  <a href="https://www.kcdh.iitb.ac.in/">Koita Centre for Digital Health</a> at IIT Bombay. His areas of research include human assisted AI/ML, AI/ML in resource constrained environments, learning with symbolic encoding of domain knowledge in ML and NLP, etc. More recently, he has been focusing his energy on organizing relevant machine learning modules for resource constrained environments into <a href="https://decile.org/">DECILE</a> . He has demonstrated the impact of such data efficient machine learning in applications such as <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~vidsurv">Video Analytics</a> , <a href="https://www.udaanproject.org/">machine translation end-to-end eco-system</a> , <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ocr">OCR</a> and in <a href="https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~malta/">multi-modal analytics</a>. He  has received awards such as IBM Faculty Award, Dr. P.K. Patwardhan Technology Development Award, and awards from Qualcomm, Microsoft as well as IIT Bombay Impactful Research Award. He also held the J.R. Isaac Chair at IIT Bombay. Ganesh is very passionate about boosting the AI research eco-system for India and towards that, the research by him and his students as well as collaborators has resulted in startups that he has either jointly founded, has transferred technology to, or is mentoring.

      <b><a href="http://lluisgomez.github.io/">Dr. Lluís Gómez</a></b> is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Computer Vision Center - Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona. He is a member of the Intelligent Reading Systems Group, where he works in developing algorithms to make computers read and understand textual information in unconstrained scenarios. He has done research stays at the Media Integration and Communication Center (MICC) - University of Florence, and the Intelligent Media Processing Group - Osaka Prefecture University, Japan. He has also collaborated with other prominent research groups in the organization of the ICDAR Robust Reading Competitions. His research interests include a variety of different topics in machine learning and computer vision. Currently he works on deep embedding models, multi modal self-supervised learning, joint modeling of textual and visual information, and CNN architectures for scene text understanding.
